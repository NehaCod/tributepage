            <h2>About Rohit Sharma</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>Sharma’s international career kicked off with an ODI match against Ireland at Belfast in June 2007, when he took one catch but did not get a chance to bat or bowl.</li><br>
                <li>Sharma scored his first ODI half-century in November 2007 and had a run of good scores in the 2007–08 ODI series in Australia, which India won. </li><br>
                <li>In 2015 Sharma scored a T20I hundred against South Africa at Dharamshala, India, becoming the second Indian to score a hundred in all three international formats. </li><br>
                <li>In 2017, when Virat Kohli, captain on the Indian ODI team at that time, was rested, Sharma was appointed captain of the ODI team in a series against Sri Lanka. He led India to victory and scored his third ODI double hundred.</li><br>
                <li>The 2019 ODI World Cup, where India made it to the semifinals, saw Sharma in a rich vein of form. He scored five centuries, the most in a single World Cup edition, and led the run charts. He was also vice captain during the tournament. </li><br>
                <li>Sharma was appointed vice captain of the Test team during the 2020 series in Australia and scored critical runs in a series India won. He continued to score heavily in the 2021 twin series against England. In February 2022 he was appointed captain of the Indian team in all three formats.</li><br>
                <li>In the 2023 ODI World Cup, Sharma led the Indian team to a clean sweep in the league phase and, in the process, set a record for the most hundreds and the most sixes in ODI World Cup history. </li><br>
                <li>Sharma was awarded the Arjuna Award, India’s second highest sporting honor, by the government of India in 2015. In 2020 he was awarded the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (since renamed Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award), India’s highest sporting honor.</li><br>
                <li>Sharma was named the ICC Men’s ODI Cricketer of the Year in 2019 and was included in the ICC Men’s ODI Team of the Year in 2014 and in each year from 2016 to 2019. He was also included in the ICC Men’s Test Team of the Year in 2021, mainly for his achievements on India’s Test tour of England that year. For the same achievements, the Wisden Cricketer’s Almanack named him one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in its 2022 edition.</li><br>
